# Chromium Broom

Chromium extension that clears **downloads** and **browsing** history on startup. 

It uses the [downloads](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/downloads) and [history](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/downloads) extension APIs separately, which seems to work better than using [browsingData](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/browsingData).

## Installation
1. Clone or download repository to a permanent location.
2. Enable developer mode on Chromium's extensions page.
3. Load chromium-broom directory using the **Load unpacked** button.
